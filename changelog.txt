# CHANGE LOG


- Experiments need algorithms for other AL strategies for comparisons
- Need to develop abstract Utils for any sequence labeling task
- Need to add Bayesian neural netowrk (bayes by backprop; monte carlo dropout) to task learner model as these are required for sampling
- Make task learner model it's own class as it'll be required for experiments (changing model types etc.)
- For sampling classes, need to look at sequence based methods (normalised log probability, etc.) - this depends on the literature in which we want to evaluate against and the task.


- Tasks
    - Text Classification (TC)
    - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    
- Add tensorboard
- model saving and checkpointing

- abstract task learner for sequence task and classification task
