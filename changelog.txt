# CHANGE LOG
## List of changes required to project

[x] - Abstract task learner for sequence task and classification task
[ ] - Review and add AL sampling strategy algorithms and training routines from referred literature
[ ] - Abstract data preprocessing for any sequence labelling task (given particular input configuration)
[ ] - Add Bayesian RNN for Bayesian AL experiments. This will be an addition to the TaskLearner module.
[ ] - Add tensorboard functionality to modules 
[ ] - Add module saving and checkpointing
[x] - Set global seeds for np, torch, etc, so that they are shared across all modules
        - Need to review if this is going to impact the modelling/experimentation...

[ ] - Add means to run tasklearner without AL to get full data performance

[ ] - Add POS from PTB so that the results can be validated on Bowman et al. 2015 (Timbmg implementation)
[ ] - Implement learning rate decay, momentum?
[ ] - Fix overlapping parameters in config being used in different sections of the codebase
[ ] - Add SVAE ELBO to tensorboard scalars
[ ] - Fix dataloaders and write active learning routine 
[ ] - Need common axis for all tensorboard metrics otherwise hard to discern what's going on / causality
[ ] - Move config read into config.py and import into each module rather than verbose code each time


Notes
- It seems that the SVAE is overtraining, might need to implement early stopping?
- It appears that the discriminator is generalising too fast (checked by making the generator have many more training cycles); how do
        we verify that the training is working successfully without the generator or discriminator overpowering one another?
        - Review Wasserstein loss and potential mode collapse as the discriminator is too strong
        
- batch normalisation of data for adversarial learning, is this required if using embeddings? how can this be used to help the
        adversarial learning of the latent space? Should we batchnorm the latent parameters before the discrim? -> BatchNorm() pytorch

- Review issue with BCE in adversarial training,
