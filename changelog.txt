# CHANGE LOG
## List of changes required to project

[x] - Abstract task learner for sequence task and classification task
[ ] - Review and add AL sampling strategy algorithms and training routines from referred literature
[ ] - Abstract data preprocessing for any sequence labelling task (given particular input configuration)
[ ] - Add Bayesian RNN for Bayesian AL experiments. This will be an addition to the TaskLearner module.
[ ] - Add tensorboard functionality to modules 
[ ] - Add module saving and checkpointing
[x] - Set global seeds for np, torch, etc, so that they are shared across all modules
        - Need to review if this is going to impact the modelling/experimentation...
